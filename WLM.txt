💡 Little’s Law – Pacing Formula



👥 Number of Users = 🔁 Iterations per Second × (⏱️ E2E Response Time + 🧠 Total Think Time + ⏳ Pacing Delay)


🔄 TPM (Transactions per Minute) = 🔁 Iterations per Second × 60

👥 Number of Users – Total concurrent virtual users

🔁 Iterations per Second – Load (TPS or IPS)

⏱️ E2E Response Time – How long one iteration takes

🧠 Think Time – Pause time between transactions

⏳ Pacing Delay – Delay between iterations



Let’s say:

🎯 Target TPM = 600

⏱️ Response Time = 3s

🧠 Think Time = 2s

⏳ Pacing Delay = 5s

👉 TPS = 600 ÷ 60 = 10 TPS

👥 Users = 10 × (3 + 2 + 5) = 10 × 10 = 100 Users
